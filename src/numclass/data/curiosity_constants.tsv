Boring number	1911	"The first ""boring number"", a positive number with the least number of classifications (4)."	Ah, well... make that 5 now, since it’s also classified as a boring number!	
Digit-Reversal constant	1089	Appears as the result of the classic three-digit reversal procedure: reverse, subtract, reverse, add.	Details: Start with 532 as example. Reverse: 235, Subtract: 532-235=297, Reverse: 792, Add: 297+792=1089.	
Kaprekar Constant (3 digit)	495	The Kaprekar constant for 3-digit numbers.	Repeatedly subtract any number formed by its digits in ascending order from that in descending order. This process converges to the Kaprekar constant 495.	
Kaprekar Constant (4 digit)	6174	The Kaprekar constant for 4-digit numbers.	Repeatedly subtract any number formed by its digits in ascending order from that in descending order. This process converges to the Kaprekar constant 6174	
Harshad in all bases	1,2,4,6	An integer that is divisible by the sum of its digits in every base ≥ 2.	Only 1, 2, 4, and 6 are Harshad in every base ≥2.	
Feller number	17	“Least random number” (Feller number).		
Belphegor’s Prime	1000000000000066600000000000001	Belphegor’s Prime: 666 with 13 zeros on either side.
