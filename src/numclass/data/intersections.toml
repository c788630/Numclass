# =============================================================================
# intersections.toml -- User-customizable intersection rules for numclass
#
# Define "intersection" classifications where a number meeting several atomic
# classes is given a combined label.
#
# HOW TO USE:
#   - Add one [[intersections]] table per rule.
#   - of = array of atomic display labels (must match classifier labels)
#   - label = the resulting intersection display label (should be unique)
#   - Order does not matter; code prefers longer (more specific) intersections.
#
# NOTE:
#   - Remove or comment rules to disable them.
#   - Restart numclass to reload changes.
#
# Intersection exceptions are: Motzkin prime, Catalan prime and Keith prime,
# because their prime classifiers (lookup) are much faster.
