## Reporting a Vulnerability

**Please do not open a public issue for security reports.**

Instead, report privately via GitHub Security Advisories:

- **Report here:** https://github.com/c788630/Numclass/security/advisories/new

When reporting, please include (as applicable):

- A clear description of the issue and why it’s a security risk  
- Steps to reproduce / minimal PoC  
- Affected versions/commit, environment (OS, Python version)  
- Potential impact and suggested mitigation (if known)

### What to expect

- **Acknowledgement:** within **72 hours**  
- **Assessment & coordination:** we’ll investigate, discuss scope, and work on a fix  
- **Disclosure:** after a fix is available and users have reasonable time to update, we’ll publish an advisory. We’re happy to **credit reporters**—tell us how you’d like to be attributed (or opt out).

If the issue is in a **third-party dependency**, we may coordinate with the upstream project.
